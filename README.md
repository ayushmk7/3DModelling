This is a complete implementation of Neural Radiance Fields for 3D reconstruction.

To use this project you need to provide your own images in the data folder and run the training pipeline. The code is fully functional and the model trains locally on your machine.

Steps:
1. Place your images in the data folder
2. Run the pipeline script to start training
3. View results in the outputs folder
